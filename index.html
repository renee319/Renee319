More than 70,000 have been wounded, meaning around 5% of the population has been killed or injured, not counting deaths from hunger, unsanitary conditions and the collapse of health care.</p>

                    <p>More than 200 days of war have taken an unimaginable toll on children in the Gaza Strip: over 14,000 have been killed and 12,000 wounded;
                        thousands more are missing. In October, families were ordered to evacuate and take shelter in Rafah in southern Gaza, 
                        swelling the city's population  from 250,000 to 1.2 million.  Now Rafah itself is under attack, placing the lives of 600,000 children at risk. 
                        On May 7, Israeli forces seized control of Rafah's vital border crossing, jeopardizing humanitarian aid deliveries that children rely on for survival.</p>

                        Dr. Ismail Mehr, with the Islamic Medical Association of North America, was recently volunteering at a hospital in Gaza. He says every day he was declaring patients dead from treatable illnesses due to a lack of supplies and the crumbling health care system.

Many Palestinians simply don't get the chance to grow old — dying in their early adulthood either in conflicts or due to a struggling healthcare system — which drags the averages down. The 16-year blockade has hampered fast access to medical care and caused shortages of essential supplies like gauze and I.V. bags, says Yara Asi — an assistant professor of global health management and informatics at the University of Central Florida.

                "They know how to laugh. They know how to make jokes. They know how to enjoy life," she said. "We cannot fail them by telling them, 'OK, we're going to go put things back to the status quo until the next war.' That's not an option."
                And she believes the children of Gaza deserve the chance to heal.
